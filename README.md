# FineMotorSkills
ASU's FSE 100 class has a project for Fine Motor Skills, 
working with a team of 3 to build a web application using **P5JS**.
The goal of this project is to create at least 3 different exercises
for toddlers to build their fine motor skills (picking up a pencil, moving a mouse, etc)

Through out this project, the team has designed:
- finite state diagrams
- flow diagrams
- gantt chart

**Timeline** can be found
